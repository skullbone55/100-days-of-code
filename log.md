## Day 3: January 30, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
Started and Finished a new puzzle.  

**Thoughts:** 
The puzzle was pretty easy. I did see a better solution so took a look at that to understand what it was doing.

## Day 2: January 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**:
Finished Code puzzle from Day 1. Spent the rest of the time re-factoring the code.

**Thoughts:** 
I was further along on the puzzle than I thought. It didn't take long to get to a passing solution. However, I wanted to explore some other ways of coding the same problem.
