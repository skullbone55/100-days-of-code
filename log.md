# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Environment setup (VS 2017). Initial commit of web app. Progressed in MVC tutorial and initial commit.

**Thoughts:** Day number one.  I have high hopes for this challenge.  I am excited and a little nervous.  I overestimated what I actually knew about ASP.NET.  I can recall the terminology, but I'm a bit lost of where to begin.  I've decided to take a couple days to refresh my memory with tutorials.
