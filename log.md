# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 9: February 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
Today I worked on creating templates in Visual Studios. 

**Thoughts:** 
Visual Studios templates helps you have a standard way of defining the structure, layout and flow of any type of application from a source app. After the definition you can create the same baseline app with the click of a button. This will save time in the future if you want to create a new App of the same architecture. I can see this being very useful in an Enterprise setting, and even more so for companies that implement SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture).

## Day 8 February 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
Today I worked on my web application. I mostly worked on the HTML and JS to get the Monthly Breakdown report to display properly. 

**Thoughts:** 
It was a productive day and got the display for the Monthly Breakdown report working. The display is not the best but it is working. I plan to improve the look and feel of the entire app later. Right now I just want to get it working.

## Day 6: February 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
Today I worked on a web application I have been working on in the last month. It's an application that lets you track costs and income. It will then show you breakdowns by Weekly or Monthly. Today I worked on the Monthly breakdown. Today, I worked on the backend to get the data to the client. 

**Thoughts:** 
It was a productive day. I decided to work on this application and move way from the puzzle. I plan on working on both of these over the next 94 days. This is so I do not get board of one thing and can improve both skills. This is to help with getting good at web development as well as get better at solving problems. Currently the repository is private. I might look at making public at a later date.

## Day 5: February 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
Continued on the same puzzle from yesterday and got all given test cases passed. Two of the hidden test cases did not pass, so I am missing something in the solution.

**Thoughts:** 
Continued on the same puzzle. I figured out how to get the decode to work and got that implemented. Still did not get all cases to pass so I will hopefully figure that out tomorrow.

## Day 3: January 30, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
Started and Finished a new puzzle.  

**Thoughts:** 
The puzzle was pretty easy. I did see a better solution so took a look at that to understand what it was doing.

## Day 2: January 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**:
Finished Code puzzle from Day 1. Spent the rest of the time re-factoring the code.

**Thoughts:** 
I was further along on the puzzle than I thought. It didn't take long to get to a passing solution. However, I wanted to explore some other ways of coding the same problem.
