# 100 Days Of Code - Log


## Day 5: February 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
Continued on the same puzzle from yesterday and got all given test cases passed. Two of the hidden test cases did not pass, so I am missing something in the solution.

**Thoughts:** 
Continued on the same puzzle. I figured out how to get the decode to work and got that implemented. Still did not get all cases to pass so I will hopefully figure that out tomorrow.

## Day 3: January 30, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
Started and Finished a new puzzle.  

**Thoughts:** 
The puzzle was pretty easy. I did see a better solution so took a look at that to understand what it was doing.

## Day 2: January 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**:
Finished Code puzzle from Day 1. Spent the rest of the time re-factoring the code.

**Thoughts:** 
I was further along on the puzzle than I thought. It didn't take long to get to a passing solution. However, I wanted to explore some other ways of coding the same problem.
